The error you're encountering (`running scripts is disabled on this system`) is due to your systemâ€™s PowerShell Execution Policy, which restricts script execution. You can fix this by changing the execution policy to allow script execution.

### Steps to fix the issue:

1. **Open PowerShell as Administrator:**
   - Search for "PowerShell" in the Start menu.
   - Right-click on "Windows PowerShell" and select "Run as Administrator."

2. **Check the Current Execution Policy:**
   Run the following command to see the current policy:

   ```powershell
   Get-ExecutionPolicy
   ```

   If it shows `Restricted`, that means script execution is disabled.

3. **Set the Execution Policy to RemoteSigned:**
   This will allow local scripts to run and only require signed scripts from remote sources. To change the execution policy, run the following command:

   ```powershell
   Set-ExecutionPolicy RemoteSigned -Scope CurrentUser
   ```

   After executing this command, PowerShell will prompt you with a warning. Type `Y` and press Enter to confirm the change.

4. **Verify the Execution Policy:**
   You can verify that the policy was changed by running:

   ```powershell
   Get-ExecutionPolicy -Scope CurrentUser
   ```

   It should now display `RemoteSigned`.

5. **Run the Firebase Command Again:**
   Close the PowerShell window and open a new one. Then try running the `firebase` command again:

   ```bash
   firebase --version
   ```

This should resolve the issue and allow you to use Firebase CLI commands without restrictions. Let me know if it works or if you encounter further issues!
